# IBM-capstone
IBM Data Science Capstone Project
This project was completed as the final capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
It demonstrates the complete data science workflow — from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis, machine learning modeling, and dashboard visualization.
The primary objective was to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings, which directly affects the company’s launch cost and reusability strategy.
